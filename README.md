SMART CANE
Project Title: Smart Cane 
Team Members: Rishab Jha, Kunal krishna, Ananya, Dipali Roy
Smart Cane: The Smart Cane is an assistive device designed to aid visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment safely and independently. It uses sensors such as ultrasonic or infrared to detect obstacles and provides real-time feedback through vibrations or audio alerts. Advanced versions may also include GPS for navigation,The goal of the project is to enhance mobility, reduce accidents, and improve the quality of life for users.
Technology used: 
1.Ultrasonic Sensors – For obstacle detection by measuring distance using sound waves.
2.Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) – To process sensor data and control outputs.
3.Vibration Motor / Buzzer – To alert the user about nearby obstacles.
4.Battery / Power Supply – To power the entire system.
steps: Code the Arduino with the given code.
